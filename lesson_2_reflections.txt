What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, a .git folder is created and it holds all the metadata that keeps track of the various versions of the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A working directory contains your last commit version and any changes you have made since. A staging area lets you choose files to be included as part of next commit. Even when you have changed a lot of files, you can only include some of them to be part of your next commit. Staging area lets you do that. A repository consists of all versions of your files.
